# Hilo

How much are you willing to lose? Play <i>HiLo</i> to find out! The rules are
simple. The dealer draws a new card. You guess if the next one will be higher or
lower. Earn 100 points if you're right. Lose 75 if you're wrong. End the game at
any time or just keep playing. Watch out though. Lose all your points and the
game is ended for you!
